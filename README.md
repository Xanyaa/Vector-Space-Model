# Vector-Space-Model
This Python script implements a Vector Space Model for information retrieval with TF-IDF. It preprocesses text, builds an inverted index, and computes TF-IDF weights for document and query vectorization. With a Streamlit interface, it offers intuitive searching, ranking documents by relevance using cosine similarity for quick, accurate results.
